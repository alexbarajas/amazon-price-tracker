This program Eetracts the prices of items on Amazon using web scraping, the Requests module, and the BeautifulSoup package. These prices are tracked and an email will be sent to you if they go below your predetermined “buy price” using the smtplib module. You’ve likely seen a web application like this before, so if you don’t want to hand out your email to a random site, you could just use this code.
