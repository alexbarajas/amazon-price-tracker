This program extracts the price of an item on Amazon using web scraping with the Requests module, and the BeautifulSoup package. This price is tracked and an email will be sent to you if it goes below your predetermined “buy price” using the smtplib module. You’ve likely seen a web application like this before, so if you don’t want to hand out your email to a random site, you could just use this code.
